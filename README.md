# Cryptography
Program that encrypts and decrpts the text
# About the program :-

   Below program can perform both the encryption as well as decryption on data. This program implements how the chats on the messenger gets encrypted and decrypted in the particular receiver device and this gives the security during the transfer of data so that no third person can read the data.
  This program takes a data in the from of the string and and performs some operation on the string and gives a unique code which is called as nonsense and send it through the internet but the internet anyone can access it but the third party person can't read the data because the sender has been converted the data into unreadable form which produces security in communication .The actual receiver can read the data by decrypting of the unique code and the decryption algorithm will be shared by the sender .By these processes we can prevent the data to be read by a third party.

# Output:-
# case1 :-
## Encrpter
### Enter the sentence that you wanted to encrypt = hello world
### Enter a 1st prime number = 3
### Enter a 2nd prime number = 5
### The cipher text = 
### U]c`h`]]VY
### The private key = 
### 15

## Decrypter
### Enter the code data = U]c`h`]]VY
### Enter the private key = 15
### Your decrpted message =
### helloworld

# case2 :- when we enter wrong key
## Decrypter
### Enter the code data =  U]c`h`]]VY
### Enter the private key = 14
### Your decrpted message =
### gdkknvnqkc.
